## Git basics

### Setup



### Use

When you start working, do a `git pull` to fetch the current state of the repository. 
If there's a conflict with any local changes you've made, git will warn you to merge the changes first. 

After you've made some changes you want to sync to the repository, save your files and run `git commit -a` to commit all changed files, instead of adding them one-by-one.
This will prompt you for a commit message. The subject should be a short description of what you changed. Optionally you can type a more detailed message in the body of the commit, or you can leave it blank. 

To send your changes, simply run `git push`.
