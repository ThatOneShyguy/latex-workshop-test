# Citation Management

## Zotero

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free and open-source program that makes it easy to keep all of your references organized, store full-text PDFs, and generate citation entries. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
There is an optional subscription to sync your library between computers.
Despite Zotero's insistence otherwise, I've had no issues keeping my library in sync using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or other cloud syncronization software should work similarly. 

## EZproxy

[EZproxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZproxy) makes it easier to access subscription items from off campus directly from journal websites, rather than searching through the university library website.
There are browser extensions for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-ezproxy-redirect/) and [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ezproxy-redirect/gfhnhcbpnnnlefhobdnmhenofhfnnfhi?hl=en&pli=1) that add a button to your browser which will take you to your university library's EZproxy redirect.
