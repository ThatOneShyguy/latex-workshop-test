## Basics of a LaTeX document

Simply create a file with the .tex extension. The first thing a document needs is a preamble, which can be as simple as `\documentclass{article}`, followed by the body of the document inside the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` environment.

A very minimal document will look something like this: 
`\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

This is the text that will appear in the compiled document.

\end{document}`
