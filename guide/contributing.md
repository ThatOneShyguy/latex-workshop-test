# How to Contribute to This Guide

My goal is to create an easy to follow step-by-step guide that's accessible to new users, but also contains some supplemental pages with more advanced information, such as useful snippets or configuration tips for editing software.
If you want to help make this guide better, there are a few ways you can contribute.

If you have questions or suggestions for the guide but aren't comfortable making a pull request yet, please feel free to open an issue or discussion in this repository and let us know.

If you'd like to contribute changes directly, you can fork the repository, make your changes and commit them to your fork, then [open a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to this repository.

The pages of this guide are written in Markdown, which is quick and [easy to learn](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
