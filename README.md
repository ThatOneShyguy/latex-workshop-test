## Overview

- What is LaTeX and why do we want to use it?
- Citation management.
- Collaboration with GitHub

## LaTeX

LaTeX is a typesetting system that produces really beautiful PDF documents. 
It has a lot of benefits over other word processing software: 
- Cross-platform, free, and open source 
- Use any text editor you like 
- Easy and fast reference management 
- Focus on writing content, not formatting 

### Editors

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- Easy to get started
- Requires a free account
- Limited to one collaborator with free accounts
- Not very customizable

[TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
- Includes some nice features like code completion

[Visual Studio Code (vscode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Very customizable and extensible
- Requires a couple of plugins and a little bit of setup
- Work on LaTeX and other code (like Python) in the same editor

[neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- The hardest to get started with
- After a learning curve, it can be the fastest editor

## Citation Management

LaTeX comes with BibTeX, which stores references as easy to read entries in a plain text file.
BibTeX files can be exported from libraries and journal websites. 
Full featured citation managers such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) can be set up to export in BibTex format, and help you keep an organized collection of PDFs.
